# Motor-Control Using PWM
# Introduction
Control speed and direction of motor by pwm on Atmega2560 with AVR toolchain.Two motor driver IC L293D used to control speed of 4 motor.(NOTE :With one motor driver we can only change speed of 4 motors but not dirction.)With the help of LEDs we can check directions and using oscilloscope we check speed-variation of motors.By applying a voltage variable source ,generate PWM wave and control speed of motors accordingly.
